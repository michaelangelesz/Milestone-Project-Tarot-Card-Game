## Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck history and citation:

The Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck is a classic tarot deck first published in 1909 by US Games Systems, Inc. It was created by Arthur Edward Waite, a British occultist and author, and Pamela Colman Smith, an American artist and illustrator. The deck features 78 cards, each with its own unique symbolism and meaning, and is widely used for divination, meditation, and spiritual guidance.

In this project, we use the Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck to create a memory game that challenges players to match pairs of cards and improve their memory skills. The cards are randomly shuffled and displayed face down on the screen, and players must flip them over one by one to find matching pairs. If they succeed, they earn points and move on to the next level. If they fail, they lose a life and must try again.

We acknowledge the creators and publishers of the Rider Waite Smith Tarot Deck for their contribution to the world of tarot and divination, and we use their work with respect and appreciation.
